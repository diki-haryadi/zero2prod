# Capturing Requirements: User Stories

### We will fullfill two user stories:
- As a blog visitor,
  I want to subscribe to the newsletter,
  So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog;
- As the blog author,
  I want to send an email to all my subscribers,
  So that I can notify them when new content is published.

### We Will not add features to
- unsubscribe;
- manage multiple newsletters;
- segment subscribers in multiple audiences;
